This Tesla needs nothing and drives perfect. It?s really clean and has a nice stance and look to it but not over done either.  Exterior: Is clean and the paint is shiny without rust on any dents or dings. There is a small Nick in the top of the rear bumper in the middle from putting something in the back like luggage. Also there is a light scuff on the left side of the front bumper down low you can?t really see it unless you get down low and look closely. Probably from pulling too far up on a curb or something. The wheels are clean with out any curb marks. This has a rear spoiler and I have the tow system with the towing receiver that has never been used and I know they are not cheap. Interior:  White leather really clean without any rips or tears. There is all weather custom fitted mats all the way\u201d Read Lessabout the seller notes ",
