I have been chasing a misfire/intermittent engine roughness and have not fully fixed it yet, the vehicle currently vibrates slightly under load, but is drivable. The A/C works great and does not leak, hasn't needed recharging since I've owned it (3years). The light on the odometer/info display is out, which is a common issue with these. It is fixable but I have not cared enough to do so. It does work intermittently however, and last time it did a few months ago I was at 158,000 miles.  These vehicles are hard to find without rust, especially in this trim with  (working) electric everything (sunroof, windows,seats,a/c,radio/cd etc.).  Clean Michigan title.  Asking 3700 OBO.

I bought this car mid pandemic because prices were so high for new cars and I wanted something fun to drive while I waited for prices to become more reasonable. Love the car and it\u2019s still my daily so miles will be going up. That being said I work remotely so won\u2019t be going up too much too fast.  If you are looking for a car in perfect cosmetic condition this car is not for you. I tried to get pictures of the cosmetic issues as best as I could. That being said mechanically it\u2019s doing great!  The bad:  - Scratches on the outside some longer ones.  - Few dings around the car. Very small though.  - Headliner was drooping. I fixed it myself (see pics) and it looks great but it obviously isn\u2019t factory perfect. Looked into getting it fixed professionally and was quoted multiple thousands so was not worth it.  - Inside plastic piece by the shifter is faded and mis colored.  - needs an alignment, will probably have one done by the time you come to see it but mentioning it just in case -wheels are all curbed. Doesn\u2019t look great but they are the original wheels.  All of these things were issues when I bought the car so can\u2019t speak to where they came from or when they happened.  The good:  -low miles considering the year  -Engine, transmission, turbo etc all in great shape. Drives great -Recently changed the radiator, fluids, oil, rear main seal -timing chain replaced (prior to me purchasing)  -cylinder head was rebuilt on this car (prior to me purchasing) If you know these cars then you know there is a defect from the factory with the timing chains and tensioners that can cause major engine damage. Whether u buy mine or another one, please check for this being done already and if another, replace the chain and tensioner with a newer one asap to avoid this issue. Anything with this done already is a much safer bet.  -My mechanic is an expert on these cars and knows this car well as he has done all the work on it and actually even sold me the car. I can share his contact if you are interested or in need of a reliable mechanic regardless of if you buy the car. He specializes in VW, Audi, Porsche but works on almost all cars I think.  Email me or chat with me in the app if interested and I can get you more info and my number. Buyer must either have cash or certified check. Make me an offer.",

If you have bigger repairs, we are usually able to do the work ourselves, charging you only for parts in advance and adding our low labor cost to your loan. Our main goal is to get you back on the road inexpensively. I don't check credit, so it's really up to you to decide whether you can afford to make the payments on time. I also don't charge late fees. If you make a late payment, I will take the car back. An Indiana license is required to be eligible for the payment plan. Call or text Blake at 765-610-7480.",

Interior is nice minus one wear spot on drivers seat. Here is what I know. The transmission needs a converter and pressure pump soon. Check engine light is on for O2 sensor , EGR. AC compressor needs replaced due to bearing worn out. Everything works, heat, windows are tinted. Jeep gets a ton of attention and is in very good shape just needs someone to spend a weekend fixing the issues it has. I am selling it to pay my daughter's schooling this year. Price is set. No trades and I will not respond to offers or spam or I can send a check please. Text me your number if interested and I'll call you back. I listed it on August 1st at 345pm. Will show the Jeep at the Cedarburg Police Station only. Yes you can drive the Jeep home if you buy it. Clear clean title. I have nothing to hide",

I have been chasing a misfire/intermittent engine roughness and have not fully fixed it yet, the vehicle currently vibrates slightly under load, but is drivable. The A/C works great and does not leak, hasn't needed recharging since I've owned it (3years). The light on the odometer/info display is out, which is a common issue with these. It is fixable but I have not cared enough to do so. It does work intermittently however, and last time it did a few months ago I was at 158,000 miles.  These vehicles are hard to find without rust, especially in this trim with  (working) electric everything (sunroof, windows,seats,a/c,radio/cd etc.).  Clean Michigan title.  Asking 3700 OBO.

I bought this car mid pandemic because prices were so high for new cars and I wanted something fun to drive while I waited for prices to become more reasonable. Love the car and it\u2019s still my daily so miles will be going up. That being said I work remotely so won\u2019t be going up too much too fast.  If you are looking for a car in perfect cosmetic condition this car is not for you. I tried to get pictures of the cosmetic issues as best as I could. That being said mechanically it\u2019s doing great!  The bad:  - Scratches on the outside some longer ones.  - Few dings around the car. Very small though.  - Headliner was drooping. I fixed it myself (see pics) and it looks great but it obviously isn\u2019t factory perfect. Looked into getting it fixed professionally and was quoted multiple thousands so was not worth it.  - Inside plastic piece by the shifter is faded and mis colored.  - needs an alignment, will probably have one done by the time you come to see it but mentioning it just in case -wheels are all curbed. Doesn\u2019t look great but they are the original wheels.  All of these things were issues when I bought the car so can\u2019t speak to where they came from or when they happened.  The good:  -low miles considering the year  -Engine, transmission, turbo etc all in great shape. Drives great -Recently changed the radiator, fluids, oil, rear main seal -timing chain replaced (prior to me purchasing)  -cylinder head was rebuilt on this car (prior to me purchasing) If you know these cars then you know there is a defect from the factory with the timing chains and tensioners that can cause major engine damage. Whether u buy mine or another one, please check for this being done already and if another, replace the chain and tensioner with a newer one asap to avoid this issue. Anything with this done already is a much safer bet.  -My mechanic is an expert on these cars and knows this car well as he has done all the work on it and actually even sold me the car. I can share his contact if you are interested or in need of a reliable mechanic regardless of if you buy the car. He specializes in VW, Audi, Porsche but works on almost all cars I think.  Email me or chat with me in the app if interested and I can get you more info and my number. Buyer must either have cash or certified check. Make me an offer.",

If you have bigger repairs, we are usually able to do the work ourselves, charging you only for parts in advance and adding our low labor cost to your loan. Our main goal is to get you back on the road inexpensively. I don't check credit, so it's really up to you to decide whether you can afford to make the payments on time. I also don't charge late fees. If you make a late payment, I will take the car back. An Indiana license is required to be eligible for the payment plan. Call or text Blake at 765-610-7480.",

Interior is nice minus one wear spot on drivers seat. Here is what I know. The transmission needs a converter and pressure pump soon. Check engine light is on for O2 sensor , EGR. AC compressor needs replaced due to bearing worn out. Everything works, heat, windows are tinted. Jeep gets a ton of attention and is in very good shape just needs someone to spend a weekend fixing the issues it has. I am selling it to pay my daughter's schooling this year. Price is set. No trades and I will not respond to offers or spam or I can send a check please. Text me your number if interested and I'll call you back. I listed it on August 1st at 345pm. Will show the Jeep at the Cedarburg Police Station only. Yes you can drive the Jeep home if you buy it. Clear clean title. I have nothing to hide",

I have been chasing a misfire/intermittent engine roughness and have not fully fixed it yet, the vehicle currently vibrates slightly under load, but is drivable. The A/C works great and does not leak, hasn't needed recharging since I've owned it (3years). The light on the odometer/info display is out, which is a common issue with these. It is fixable but I have not cared enough to do so. It does work intermittently however, and last time it did a few months ago I was at 158,000 miles.  These vehicles are hard to find without rust, especially in this trim with  (working) electric everything (sunroof, windows,seats,a/c,radio/cd etc.).  Clean Michigan title.  Asking 3700 OBO.

I bought this car mid pandemic because prices were so high for new cars and I wanted something fun to drive while I waited for prices to become more reasonable. Love the car and it\u2019s still my daily so miles will be going up. That being said I work remotely so won\u2019t be going up too much too fast.  If you are looking for a car in perfect cosmetic condition this car is not for you. I tried to get pictures of the cosmetic issues as best as I could. That being said mechanically it\u2019s doing great!  The bad:  - Scratches on the outside some longer ones.  - Few dings around the car. Very small though.  - Headliner was drooping. I fixed it myself (see pics) and it looks great but it obviously isn\u2019t factory perfect. Looked into getting it fixed professionally and was quoted multiple thousands so was not worth it.  - Inside plastic piece by the shifter is faded and mis colored.  - needs an alignment, will probably have one done by the time you come to see it but mentioning it just in case -wheels are all curbed. Doesn\u2019t look great but they are the original wheels.  All of these things were issues when I bought the car so can\u2019t speak to where they came from or when they happened.  The good:  -low miles considering the year  -Engine, transmission, turbo etc all in great shape. Drives great -Recently changed the radiator, fluids, oil, rear main seal -timing chain replaced (prior to me purchasing)  -cylinder head was rebuilt on this car (prior to me purchasing) If you know these cars then you know there is a defect from the factory with the timing chains and tensioners that can cause major engine damage. Whether u buy mine or another one, please check for this being done already and if another, replace the chain and tensioner with a newer one asap to avoid this issue. Anything with this done already is a much safer bet.  -My mechanic is an expert on these cars and knows this car well as he has done all the work on it and actually even sold me the car. I can share his contact if you are interested or in need of a reliable mechanic regardless of if you buy the car. He specializes in VW, Audi, Porsche but works on almost all cars I think.  Email me or chat with me in the app if interested and I can get you more info and my number. Buyer must either have cash or certified check. Make me an offer.",

If you have bigger repairs, we are usually able to do the work ourselves, charging you only for parts in advance and adding our low labor cost to your loan. Our main goal is to get you back on the road inexpensively. I don't check credit, so it's really up to you to decide whether you can afford to make the payments on time. I also don't charge late fees. If you make a late payment, I will take the car back. An Indiana license is required to be eligible for the payment plan. Call or text Blake at 765-610-7480.",

Interior is nice minus one wear spot on drivers seat. Here is what I know. The transmission needs a converter and pressure pump soon. Check engine light is on for O2 sensor , EGR. AC compressor needs replaced due to bearing worn out. Everything works, heat, windows are tinted. Jeep gets a ton of attention and is in very good shape just needs someone to spend a weekend fixing the issues it has. I am selling it to pay my daughter's schooling this year. Price is set. No trades and I will not respond to offers or spam or I can send a check please. Text me your number if interested and I'll call you back. I listed it on August 1st at 345pm. Will show the Jeep at the Cedarburg Police Station only. Yes you can drive the Jeep home if you buy it. Clear clean title. I have nothing to hide",
