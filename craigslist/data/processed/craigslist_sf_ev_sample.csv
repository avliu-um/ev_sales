Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.This post is almost 30 days old.

Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.Do you take trade-ins?Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?Yes.

Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.Do you take trade-ins?Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.As America's Largest Automotive Retailer we have thousands of other vehicles, including many others that may be identical to this one.Use the link below to view inventory from this and other nearby dealerships.    http://atmxi.com/inventory/5145Description:* Cherry Red Tintcoat  * Lane Keeping Assist  * Keyless Start  * Audio System; Chevrolet Infotainment 3 Plus System  * Charge Cord; Dual Level; 120-Volt And 240-Volt Capability  * Electric Drive Unit; (200 Hp [150 Kw] 266 Lb-Ft Of Torque [360 N-M])  * Emissions; California State Requirements  * Emissions; California Zev  * Engine; None  * Jet Black; Cloth Seat Trim  * License Plate Bracket; Front; Front Mounting  * Lt Preferred Equipment Group  * Seats; Front Bucket  * Wheels; 17"" (43.2 Cm) Silver Painted AluminumThis vehicle includes a Money-Back Guarantee* and passed our precise inspection process.

No accidents or damages. Save $$$$'s in gasoline costs. Great features and Fun to drive. 10 Reasons to Buy a 2017 Nissan Leaf  1. Unbeatable Range In comparison to all other electric vehicles on the market that aren’t Tesla products, the 2017 Nissan Leaf has the largest range by far. With an impressive 107 mile range on a single charge  getting around in this car without stopping to charge frequently is easy. Though it often doesn’t quite reach that 107 mile mark, it definitely comes close. 2. Regenerative Braking The regenerative braking ability in the Nissan Leaf feels particularly satisfying. Regenerative braking is a feature that allows for some energy to be generated for the battery due to the friction of braking. The Leaf has multiple settings for regenerative braking, including one that automatically increases how much occurs when not pressing on the gas pedal. 3. The Leaf EZ-Charge App Nissan has a smartphone app that’s intuitive and easy to use. Any Apple or Android phone can have the app, that will help you find a charging station before you have to worry. 4. Quick Charge Option When traveling, charging an electric car can take extra time. Charging ports are around us in well traveled areas, shopping center parking lots and eateries.  A quick charge is actually great for getting a perfect break to stretch your legs. Nissan has included a special port on the SV trim that allows for a quick charge of the battery. A 30 minute charge brings the battery from low to around 80% full. 5. Room to Stretch Nissan Leaf was designed with user comfort in mind. Since the vehicle was built to keep the battery out of the user space, there’s plenty of leg room for both the front and back seats. The cargo space measures in at an impressive 24 cubic feet. 6. Great Customization The SV trim includes an upgraded technology center with special navigation and mobile apps, an easily accessible quick charge port and a seven speaker Bose premium audio system. 7. Traction Control The 2017 Nissan Leaf has a great computer system to assist drivers with control of the car and the traction control does a great job of keeping the car from sliding. 8. Charging Charge at home, at work or in popular traveled shopping areas. Charging stations are available around us and new ones are continually being installed.. 9. Great Camera Systems The 2017 Nissan Leaf rearview camera for both easy parking and checking if there’s something around you.  10. No Driving Noise With its graceful aerodynamic design the Leaf makes almost no noise when driving. It is quieter than most electric cars, with only a tiny high-pitched noise occurring with continuous acceleration.

Only driven less than 850miles so far. This is the highest end version of Tesla Model Y. I'm an old car mechanic and I bought it from an insurance company auction in Colorado for a Salvage Title because it had a front collision. But the front frame of the car is aluminum, very strong, and It's a storage box, so a crash hardly affects any of its vital parts, even the airbags are intact. Just Body work. I restored it with OEM color-coded parts and did a wheel alignment test; now it runs like new. So Great! The car is now in my name. The market price of the same model is at least $60,000 or more, and the immediate government tax rebate will cost more than $53,000. And my asking price is only $42999. At the same time, if you buy a private car, you will save a lot of taxes and fees.

The car was used as a commuter and never abused. The car comes with a Ford charger, all-weather mats, 2 keys and unused carpet mats. The car also has a 2-inch receiver with a 350lb tongue weight that was professionally installed. The wheels are in perfect shape without any curb rash. Never had kids, animals or smoke in the car; it really is in beautiful shape. The only blemish on the car is a very small door ding on the driver door (see photo) while it was parked at the grocery store.  The car is Rear Wheel Drive and comes with the standard 70kWh battery. It was only charged to 100% a few times and when it was, it estimated the range at 250 miles. You won't find a Mach-E in this condition! I am willing to work with the buyer on the title's sale price to make sure Tax liability, PGE credit and/or Federal Tax Credits are considered. The car still has a Lien with Bank of America and will need to be paid off before title is transferred.

Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.Do you take trade-ins?Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.As America's Largest Automotive Retailer we have thousands of other vehicles, including many others that may be identical to this one.Use the link below to view inventory from this and other nearby dealerships.    http://atmxi.com/inventory/5137Description:* Driving Assistance Professional Package  * Black; Vernasca Leather Upholstery  * Bmw Curved Display W/Hud  * Premium Package  * Harman/Kardon Surround Sound System  * Parking Assistance Package  * Skyscraper Grey Metallic  * Sun/Moonroof  * Heated Front Seats  * Leather Seats  * Navigation System  * Sensatec Dashboard  * Ambient Lighting  * Wireless Device Charging  * Drive Recorder  * Lane Keeping Assist  * Keyless Start  * Heads-Up Display  * Open Pore Fine Wood Oak Grain Trim00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 convertible coupe hatchback mini-van offroad pickup sedan truck suv wagon van fwd rwd awd 4wd gas diesel hybridSubject to prior sale.

Getting a BMS_u029 error code will reduce your range to 50 miles or less (enough to get to the Tesla service center), and requires you to pay $21,000 for a battery pack replacement. But what Tesla owners are doing now is pay $500 to reset the code and sell the vehicle as-is, without telling you that the vehicle had the BMS_u029 error code. Used car companies are also buying these defective vehicles for $10k to $12k, resetting the error code, and selling them at full price. (Google Hybrid ReVolt in AZ and you'll find that they are selling a reset device for $750.) If you decide to buy a used Tesla, then demand that the seller provide a signed and dated letter stating that you can return the vehicle for a full refund if the vehicle displays any error or requires any repairs (like a new drive unit) within 90 days of purchase. (Ask an attorney to be sure. I'm not offering legal advice.) This vehicle that I'm selling had the BMS_u029 error code and the code was reset for $500. There is no way to tell or test if the vehicle had the BMS_u029 code. It works like a regular Tesla and charges up to 270 miles. It works on Tesla's Superchargers and gets Free Lifetime Supercharging. If you want to buy it then it's up to you.

Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.Do you take trade-ins?Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.As America's Largest Automotive Retailer we have thousands of other vehicles, including many others that may be identical to this one.Use the link below to view inventory from this and other nearby dealerships.    http://atmxi.com/inventory/5145Description:* Amg Line Exterior Package  * Manufaktur Diamond White  * Multi-Contour Front Seats W/Massage Feature  * Wheels: 21"" X 9.5J Amg Multi-Spoke W/Black Accents  * Laminated Safety Glass  * Panoramic Roof  * Active Ambient Lighting  * Leather Seats  * Navigation System  * Rapid Heating Front Seats  * Heated Steering Wheel  * Dashcam  * Lane Keeping Assist  * Keyless Start  * Rear Spoiler  * Cooled Front Seat(S)  * Brown Walnut Wood Dashboard & Door Trim  * Grey Headliner  * Neva Grey/Sable Brown; Leather Seat TrimThis vehicle includes a Money-Back Guarantee* and passed our precise inspection process.

Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.Do you take trade-ins?Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?Yes.

Low mileage (39,998 miles!) and garaged in the Bay Area, it's very tough to find a 914 in this condition with little to no rust, very decent original interior and what looks like shiny original black paint.  Bolted to the nicely functioning transaxle and clutch is a massive General Electric DC motor from a 1970s Bradley GTE, known as the ""rolls royce"" of DC electric motors. This motor has a steel commutator and can take more rpm and abuse than others like it. There are two lithium A123 battery modules up front from Thunderstruck motors in Santa Rosa. Two new Thunderstruck battery chargers mounted above the motor can fill the battery from empty in two hours. A battery management system from Thunderstruck has also been installed. This drive system has been trouble free and enjoyable to drive. Think ""set it and forget it"" and not endless tinkering and trouble.  The previous owner converted the car in the 1990s, so the motor and curtis controller are from that era, and are of relatively low voltage. The 10kwh battery has much larger capacity than the original lead acid pack and much smaller (weighs about 200 pounds). It's currently running at 90 volts, so top speed is about 75 mph, but still plenty of fun low speed torque. I have another motor and controller I can include that would significantly increase top speed and more than double the power with some simple changes to the battery arrangement to double the voltage. It's current range is about 30 miles, depending on how you drive it.  I've enjoyed working on this car and it's been lovely to drive it around. The suspension and steering feel quite nice, thanks to the bilstein shocks, relatively low miles and all new vredestein tires. The gauge cluster was recently restored and brake master cylinder replaced.  It doesn't need a whole lot to be a solid driver. The front struts appear to rattle while driving, there's a small leak from the brake reservoir hose and most of the weatherstripping needs to be replaced to keep rain out of the car. Around $300 worth of rubber seals are included.  So fix a few things and drive it as is, or upgrade for relatively cheap. Replacing the battery in the frunk with four tesla modules or three VW id4 modules would double the range at the same battery weight and be relatively easy to do.  It's far simpler to work on than a modern ev and more fun to drive. If you are a serious buyer write me an email that indicates you read the whole ad and are serious about keeping it electric. Otherwise I may ignore it.

Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.Do you take trade-ins?Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.As America's Largest Automotive Retailer we have thousands of other vehicles, including many others that may be identical to this one.Use the link below to view inventory from this and other nearby dealerships.    http://atmxi.com/inventory/5148Description:* Panoramic Roof  * Navigation System  * Keyless Start  * Rear SpoilerThis vehicle includes a Money-Back Guarantee* and passed our precise inspection process.

Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.Do you take trade-ins?Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.As America's Largest Automotive Retailer we have thousands of other vehicles, including many others that may be identical to this one.Use the link below to view inventory from this and other nearby dealerships.    http://atmxi.com/inventory/5148Description:* Panoramic Roof  * Navigation System  * Keyless Start  * Rear SpoilerThis vehicle includes a Money-Back Guarantee* and passed our precise inspection process.

7656264893,2023-08-18 12:44:49-07:00,owner,51000.00,USD,2023,2023 tesla,7SAYGDEEXPF700777,electric,hatchback,,3100,,4wd,clean,automatic,grey,new,CA,San Jose,95134,US,,-121.940600,37.408700,2023-09-17 19:44:49+00:00,"QR Code Link to This Post LIKE NEW (~3100 miles) Tesla Model Y Long Range 2023 in Midnight Silver Metallic and 19 inch wheels. [REPOSTING due to the last buyer (from Southern California) cancelling on the pickup day and forfeiting the cashiers check transactions. The buyer changed his mind after the cashiers check had been deposited into my account and refused to take the car and title. I had no choice because he had his bank cancel the cashiers check through a ""stop payment"" 😥] **First off, I just want to let you know that if you qualify for the $7,500 federal tax credit, you should order directly from Tesla instead of buying from me (or anyone else), since buying from a third-party means you won't be able to get $7,500 off. If you qualify for the federal tax credit, please just ignore this listing.** (Those who buy from me would only benefit if if they DON'T qualify for the federal tax credit and plan to get paint protection film + window tint) I picked up my vehicle on March 7th, 2023, and as of today, it has around 3,100 miles on it. The car has PPF + Window Tint on it, which costed me over $2000. I currently drive this vehicle around 75 miles per week for work. Otherwise, it just stays in my garage. I took it to a shop to get paint protection film (PPF) shortly after picking up my car. I decided to go for the full front PPF package, which costed me $1,500 for. The shop applied the Avery Dennison Supreme Defense PPF on my car, which you can find more info on here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRoGgNJGxms&ab_channel=TESBROS . Since I got PPF almost as soon as I got my car, I am not aware of any major rock chips or damages on the vehicle.  For window tinting, the shop I took my car to used 3M Ceramic IR window tint, and I opted for 70% on the front windshield + front two windows + back windshield, and 35% for the rear two doors + quarter panels. (To me, 70% tint looks almost the same as no tint. I opted for 70% tint because that is the legal limit for the front two doors, while still having the heat rejection properties. My goal wasn't the dark looks, but heat rejection). I did not get my sunroof tinted, as I believe that it already comes pre-tinted from the factory. The shop quoted me $600 for tinting.  I've also installed mud flaps on the front that I bought from here: https://www.vion.parts/products/model-y-mud-flaps. I didn't install the back mud flaps, but can give them to you for you to install if you'd like! These cost me $40.  In regards to charging, I haven't charged my vehicle at home nor at any Tesla supercharging stations. I've only charged my car at work, since we have free charging through ChargePoint chargers. I have also only charged it to 80% at max.  I also want to be transparent with you that this vehicle probably isn't ""special"" in any way—it's probably like any other Teslas with build quality issues. I've had to take it to the Tesla service center a couple times to get a couple minor/cosmetic issues fixed such as rattles from the camera housing unit. They have fixed every single issue (surprisingly!). The Tesla service folks have told me multiple times that I am very sensitive to these things. Coming from driving a car with more luxurious suspension system before this, I found my Tesla to have a rougher ride quality than I had expected and therefore maybe I've been sensitive to the things that my previous car did not have. Or maybe I just had too high of an expectation for Tesla build quality 😅. I hope to sell this car and hopefully get a Genesis GV60 EV or a Genesis GV70 Electrified. Right now, I see that the exact same config Tesla listed on their website is $52,130 before taxes: """""" Model Y Long Range Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive ($50,490) Midnight Silver Metallic Paint 19’’ Gemini Wheels All Black Premium Interior Five Seat Interior Autopilot 30-Day Premium Connectivity Trial Vehicle Price: $50,490 Destination fee: $1,390 Order fee: $250 Your Model Y: $52,130 Excluding taxes & other fees """""" (Please see last photo for exact details). And if you see the last picture, the total price comes out to ~$58,225 if you buy from Tesla directly. Also, the new Tesla Model Ys if you order directly from the Tesla website as of June 2023 now come with an infotainment computer system that has 128gb of storage and 8gb of RAM due to Tesla's cost cutting measures, which is half of what my Tesla Model Y has. (Mine has 256gb of storage and 16gb of RAM). So if you want to pay ~$3000-$4000 less (including total with taxes) AND want PPF + window tint AND don't mind the ~3100 miles on the car AND want a better infotainment computer (AND don't qualify for the tax credit), then this car might be right for you! Please do let me know if you have any questions! I'd be happy to answer them. And if you'd like to come check out the car for yourself, we can setup a time to meet. Thanks!",https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/cto/d/san-jose-like-new-3100-miles-2023-tesla/7656264893.html,LIKE NEW (~3100 miles) 2023 Tesla Model Y Long Range,"LIKE NEW (~3100 miles) Tesla Model Y Long Range 2023 in Midnight Silver Metallic and 19 inch wheels.

More information about the 2015 Tesla Model S: The problem with electric vehicles has always been range. Tesla has dealt with this by employing bigger and better batteries in the Model S than have previously been seen in electric vehicles. Even with the smallest batteries in its most basic trim, Tesla still claims a 200-plus mile range for the Model S, easily besting the range of any of its potential competitors. Beyond the drivetrain though, the Model S is a competent luxury car with impressive performance. There is plenty of room both inside the passenger cabin and in the trunk, making the Model S both spacious and practical. The car can even be fitted with a pair of rear facing jump seats, which pushes the seating total up to seven. Model S ownership starts at under $70,000, making it comparable to many European large luxury sedans, and while the Model S matches most of these sedans in terms of luxury and performance, it offers other benefits unmatched in any category. Strengths of this model include competitive pricing, luxurious interior with plenty of space, great performance, good looks, and All-electric drivetrain00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 convertible coupe hatchback mini-van offroad pickup sedan truck suv wagon van fwd rwd awd 4wd gas diesel hybridSubject to prior sale.

Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.Do you take trade-ins?Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?Yes.

I am only letting it go because I need a truck for my new job.  Always garaged, it is immaculate outside and inside. No dent, no scratch, no pets, no smoking, no kids. Everything is running like new. It can be seen in San Francisco area. 4 Wheel Drive = 2 Engines = 295 HP + Instant power. If you have never driven an electric car, this car will surprise you. Very smooth and easy while in the city but if you press the pedal, it will take off, instantly (zero lag, unlike the new turbo car I will unfortunately end up with for new job).  The maximum range 260 Miles. This car can be plugged to superchargers so it recharges fast, usually 35 minutes from 20% to 80%. You go shopping or get a coffee and you are good to go for 200 miles. You can also charge it at home, the car comes with the cable, in the hidden compartment of the trunk. Here are some of its main features: - Under full manufacturer warranty until the end of the lease AND free maintenance as well. - UNLIMITED FREE Charging for the remainder at Electrify America stations nationwide until mid-December 2024. - 4 Wheel Drive - 295 HP, 339 lb-ft  --  0-60 in 5.6 Seconds + Instant Acceleration at any speed! - CALIFORNIA CARPOOL / HOV Stickers good for a few years (beyond the end of this lease). - Wireless Carplay (car connects to phone as you enter the car, no cable needed). I think it does Android too but I have an Iphone. - Wireless Phone charging - 2 Memory seats with Massage Driver AND Passenger - Heated front seats and steering wheel. Perforated front seats help keeping it cool in summer - Adaptive Cruise Control AND Lane Assist (basically the car drives itself but you have to keep a hand on the wheel about every 30 seconds). Works great on Highway and slow traffic. - Huge roof glass - Seats 5 people comfortably and 2nd row falls flat so it has a surprisingly large trunk capacity. - Power liftgate WITH Foot Kick opening system under bumper - Backup Camera with optional Wide Angle + Bumpers sensors front and back + Blind Spot Monitor  - Great sound system. With Apple Carplay you can listen to any app on your phone. It will read your messages and you can very conveniently answer. - You can also control several features of the car remotely via the VW phone app. My favorite is heating up or cooling the car remotely before you get in). You can control the charging as well (without going to your garage, for example). - Exterior is Dusk Blue Metallic - Interior is Lunar Gray leatherette (nice under California sun/heat) - Tires are great because the car has very low mileage",https://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/cto/d/san-carlos-id4-pro-awd-only-13k-miles/7656903004.html,ID4 Pro S - AWD 2021 - only 13K miles,"ID.4 Pro S - 4WD  Under VW Warranty + Free Maintenance + FREE RECHARGE until Mid December 2024    This car is like NEW.
