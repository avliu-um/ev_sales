Elevate your Burning Man journey with a van that's tailor-made for the Playa and beyond. Introducing an exceptional van that's been thoughtfully upgraded and crafted to make your Burning Man 2023 truly extraordinary. Everybody, meet Giraldo: the ultimate 2023 Burning Van Standout Features for Your Burner Adventure: Reliable Upgrades: Get ready for an epic adventure with peace of mind. We've recently replaced the alternator and turbo resonator to ensure smooth performance as you embark on your Burning Man odyssey. Camper Oasis: Embrace comfort in the heart of the desert with an interior that's 90% finished as a camper. Revel in the convenience of a refrigerator, sink, and 30-gallon water tank. While the sink's finishing touches are just a water pump replacement away (around $100 and easy to do), the stage is set for you to create the perfect setup. Solar Power: This van is equipped with a full solar system that offers true off-grid liberation. With 4 panels producing a whopping 780 watts and two 12-volt deep cell sealed batteries connected in a 24-volt system, you'll have all the energy you need. The 5000-watt inverter ensures you're powered up for all your Burning Man adventures. Versatile Interior Space: Created for both practicality and comfort, this van boasts ample storage and counter space. Its layout is designed to accommodate a queen-size bed, and we're including a full-size foam mattress for your convenience. Stealthy Camping: The desert is your playground, and this van is your secret weapon. Its inconspicuous appearance, blacked-out windows, and discreet design allow you to camp anywhere, undetected.  Proven Performance: With a well-maintained, battle-tested 5-cylinder Mercedes Benz engine, this van is built to handle the desert's demands and beyond, known to reach over a million miles of epic journeys. Staggering Storage Capacity: I recently moved out of my apartment and was able to fit everything I own in the underbelly. You will not run out of room.  Nomadic Soul: Range anxiety does not exist when you ride with Giraldo: I was able to cross half of Nevada on half a tank of diesel. While he might not go fast - he can't run quite as quickly as he used to - but he will go far. He's made multiple trips across the country - are you ready to add your chapters to the story?  Like any sprinter van that's been around the block a couple of times, Giraldo has some personality quirks. He needs to be locked manually and you have to access storage from the outside. The interior is also 6 feet high, so I also can't fully stand up inside, which is the primary reason why I'm looking to sell. He also requires some attention - a Maxx fan, rewiring the electrical, replacing the pump on the sink, treating rust on the body - that I can't provide right now. If you want to put your handiness to the test, Giraldo is a perfect opportunity to practice.  The Playa is waiting, and this van is your ticket to a one-of-a-kind Burning Man 2023. Whether it's your first burn or you're a seasoned desert wanderer, this van promises to be the epicenter of your unforgettable journey. Reach out now to secure your chance to own this incredible adventure vehicle. Let the anticipation build \u2013 your Burning Man adventure begins with the ignition of this remarkable van. Price: This baby is insured at $14,000 and the solar plus electrical add on an additional 6k. But I'm flexy on price and prepared to throw in amenities to make your future adventures that much smoother - make me an offer!",

Bought for 4K and have purchased way over 3k in parts, taking a loss at this price :/ Open to offers\u2026Sold As Is. Details: Has brand new front disc brake conversion New QA1 K member and sway bar QA1 lower controller arms and strut rods We purchased with no title (the person we purchased from did not have the title either) There are 2 transmissions that came with the car but we don\u2019t know what state they are in The 360 was intact, fresh motor as far as we can tell The engine block has been painted. A new front sump deep well oil pan, new aluminum water pump, stamped valve covers, and a restored Edelbrock intake manifold. Comes with Edelbrock carb New after market radiator support installed that can handle multiple width radiators. And new drivers side apron installed as well. There is a back seat but no front seat, no dash or other interior trim Fenders and grille plus bumper we have but they have been removed while we work (that\u2019s why they are not in images) All glass is present The car does not seem to have rust issues to the best of our knowledge We have a brand new power disc brake master cylinder and brand new power steering box as well plus other random steering and suspension components in boxes Steering linkage was missing when purchased. We have the original steering column and other disassembled parts",

For us, its too much at the moment to fix and we needed a bigger vehicle, as our kids are getting bigger. The car has registration until 2024, the car has been sitting at our mechanic's shop since February. We were still debating on fixing it until May, but we decided to put our money until buying a bigger vehicle. The car has been well taken care of, interior is 8/10, obviously the leather has normal wear but no tears, interior is clean, everything works, AC, radio, CD, all lights and dash components. The Vehicle has about 120,000 miles (do not remember exact mileage but more or less to 120k). Has stock chrome-alloy wheels, brakes were replaced last year in March, oil change done regularly. Got a spare tire in the back, with jack and tire iron. Clean title, vehicle has 3 keys total (2 fobs, 1 valet key).  FYI, the vehicle will need to be towed.  I might've missed some other info, but feel free to send me a text if you have any questions about the car.  Phone calls only after 5pm, Mon-Thurs, anytime Fri, Sat, Sun.  Text anytime, but I might not reply for a few hrs before 5pm Mon-Thurs. $1500 OBO, Cash only please.",

One of our loyal clients has been the only owner and serviced the vehicle for its entire life right here at Toyota Sunnyvale.  Due to this we know this to be a quality vehicle!!!  While most vehicles over 100000 miles don't pass our safety inspection and require us to auction the vehicle this is an exception to the norm.

Source: Edmunds * The Lexus IS line showcases a bold and captivating design, with additional interior room, and better handling than before. In front there is an incredibly stylish yet aggressive spindle grille and angled headlights. The rest of the body is exquisitely shaped, with dramatic, aerodynamic lines. Plus, with its wider stance, stretched wheelbase, and underbody panels to further reduce wind resistance, this car was designed to move. Lexus gives you a wide range of model variations to pick from. There is the 204hp IS 250 and IS 250 F Sport, as well as the 306hp IS 350 and IS 350 F Sport. Each can be purchased with Rear-Wheel Drive or All-Wheel Drive. The IS 250 models come with a 2.5L V6, that gets up to 21 MPG City and 30 MPG hwy. The IS 350 Models come with a 3.5L V6 that gets up to 19 MPG City and 28 MPG hwy. The IS interior is incredible. It has low sport seating in front, and close to 3 extra inches of legroom in back. The highly comfortable NuLuxe faux-leather seats are not to be missed, and extra headroom in front and back will keep you from feeling constrained. Plus, if you purchase any of the F Sport models, prepare to be amazed by the advanced digital instrument cluster. Lexus has given the IS line a generous array of standard features. Some items include a power moonroof, push-button start, drive mode select and an 8-speaker Sound System that comes with a 7-inch color screen. Some standard safety features you get are 10 airbags, anti-lock brakes, brake assist, and traction control. As an option, some incredible safety technology available includes the Pre-Collision System with Dynamic Radar Cruise Control, Intuitive Parking Assist, and Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Cross-Traffic Alert. Source: The Manufacturer Summary * If you???re looking for an entry-level luxury sedan, but want something with dynamically out-there styling to back up its driving characteristics, you can???t do better than the 2015 Lexus IS sedan. Yeah, we just said a Lexus is the most visually striking sedan in its class. How times change.

The 5 Series is no exception. Available in two flavors, 528i or 540i, drivers can choose a sedan or a sport-wagon body style.528i models are powered by a 2.8-liter inline 6-cylinder engine that provides excellent midrange torque and makes 193 horsepower. The 528i comes with a standard five-speed manual transmission, or can be optioned with a five-speed Steptronic automanual transmission.Under the hoods of the 540i sedans and sport wagons sit 4.4-liter, 32-valve V8s that offer zero-to-60 times in the low sixes, make 282 horsepower and can also be mated to five-speed Steptronic automanual transmissions, if desired. The 540i sedan continues to be available with a six-speed manual transmission. If you love to drive, opt for this model and prepare yourself for an invigorating ride. The suspension is pleasantly firm on this lively model, but it is difficult to operate the transmission smoothly.As one would expect in a top-end, luxury/sport vehicle, equipment levels are first rate. Standard fare includes rear self-leveling suspension, car and key programmable memory, dual zone air conditioning and cruise control with steering wheel controls. All-Season Traction (AST), Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) and Dynamic Brake Control are standard on all 2000 5-Series cars. Rain-sensing windshield wipers and Xenon headlights are standard on 540 models and optional on the 528s this year.Standard safety equipment includes 9-mph bumpers, dual airbags, door-mounted side-impact airbags, and a front head-protection system. Three-point seatbelts at all seating positions, impact sensors that unlock the doors and activate the hazard lights in the event of a serious accident, remote keyless entry, two-step unlocking, coded drive-away protection, and a vehicle security system are also standard. Rear-passenger side-impact airbags are optional.Contact Info:The Car StoreButch Washington - (408) 297-97001271 S. First St.San Jose, CA 95110",

It is still in showroom condition, in and out.   Have to see in person to appreciate.  Photos do not do justice. All maintenance performed based on time, not miles. BBS wheels on the vehicle but still have original wheels with original tires (looks new) for the sake of originality. The only modification that has been made is a new suede headliner as the original one fell off due to age of the glue. Please only contact me if you can appreciate the rareness and are serious about owning this car.  The price is firm.  I will only entertain test drives after seeing proof of funds.",

Within the last year, following items have been replaced. - All four tires - All brake pads and rotors - Engine mounts - Fan clutch - Ignition lock assembly - Muffler - Power Steering pump - Serpentine belt - Thermostat - Water pump AC needs recharge and sunroof will need adjustment.  Would have gotten to these if not moving. Odometer stopped at 132,224 but the actual reading should be less than 142,000. According to Hagerty, this vehicle should sell between $15,400 to $7,200.  You can buy this classic German daily drivable car with no required immediate maintenance at a substantial discount for the price of a 20 years old Corolla.",

        "seller_notes": "QR Code Link to This Post 2015 Subaru WRX base (FA engine, not an STI), 65k+ miles, completely stock drivetrain, mild quality of life and exterior/interior mods, android auto/apple car play - $19,000.00 VIN: JF1VA1A67F9806083 Title: Clean Mileage: 65,XXX (it will be slightly up from the current ODO reading, I barely drive the thing these days) \u201cIs this still available?\u201d If the ad is up it sure is :) Please read before contacting me: Serious inquiries only please. Price is pretty much firm, but will consider reasonable offers once you\u2019ve checked out the car. No trades. No lowballs. No test drives without full cash in hand. I\u2019m looking to try out something else, hence why it\u2019s up for sale. If you\u2019re someone who wants a fun, manual-transmission analog driving experience, but doesn\u2019t want to give up room and practicality then this might be the car for you. TL;DR:  - 2015 Subaru WRX base (FA20 DIT engine, Turbo Flat 4), - $19,000.00  -65k+ miles, -completely stock engine/drivetrain -android auto/apple car play -mild quality of life and interior mods, some exterior flourishes, upgraded lighting (see below for full list) I\u2019ll do my best to be as transparent as possible as I really don\u2019t want to sell someone a clapped out catastrophe they would regret buying. I\u2019m happy to answer any questions and/or provide additional pictures & service records. The Good: -The car is pretty much bone stock and runs great (absolutely no engine/drivetrain mods), besides a few interior and exterior mods, and some quality of life upgrades (like the android auto/apple car play headunit, see below for a full list of mods). -I\u2019ve taken meticulous care of it. Many more service history records besides what you\u2019ll see on the carfax. -Oil changes every 3k miles (5W30 full-synthetic), never smoked/vaped in, never tracked. -Brand new front catalytic converter ($2400 parts and labor, have service records) -Garage-kept in the bay area throughout its whole life -Continental Extremecontact DWS06 tires with less than 10k miles on it -\u201dOEM+\u201d interior for adults: Factionfab suede steering wheel & shift boot, carbon fiber handbrake handle, JDM leather center gauge lid, etc - 2 keys, wheel locks, tow hook cover, all original documents (see images) The \u201cHmmm\u201d: -I am the 3rd owner according to Carfax. That being said, the previous owner is a good friend of mine who also took meticulous care of the car for the majority of its current mileage. -You will notice a Carfax service history gap from the previous owner between 19k miles-57k miles. The dealership (Carlsen Subaru Redwood City) where it was serviced during that time period isn\u2019t part of the Carfax network unfortunately, hence no carfax record entries. Imperfections: -usual wear you\u2019d see on a 65k+ mile car -some curb rash on both rear wheels (I acknowledge my defeat in shame) -small paint chip near gas cap -scratches on roof (must have scraped some tree branches, don\u2019t know what happened here) -Center Armrest storage latch tends to come loose, this is a known issue apparently.  Full list of mods: Tires: Continental Extremecontact DWS 06 (high performance all seasons) w/ less than 10k miles. Exterior: -Grimmspeed license plate relocation kit -JDM front grille -JDM front lip -Rally armour mud flaps -black front and rear Subaru badges -black rear \u201cWRX\u201d badge -front \u201cWRX\u201d license plate hole cover Quality of life: -Perrin shift stop + bushings (makes for much notchier shifts and gets rid of the loose stock shifter feel) -Pioneer touchscreen stereo (android auto & apple car play) Interior: -Factionfab suede steering wheel (ill include the OEM plastic steering wheel of course) -Suede shift boot -leather JDM center gauge lid -Carbon fiber handbrake handle -Subaru OEM all weather mats Electrical: -Hella tones horns -Diode dynamics switchback c-light DRL & turn signal -Diode Dynamics HIDs (5000k temp) -F1 style brake light",

It's not a huge deal, I just leave the O/D off unless it's needed.   Four General Grabber tires that are about three years old.  The back two scrap the body a tiny bit when going over bumps too fast or going into driveways at an angle (this almost never happens if you drive conservatively).  They should probably be replaced with something a bit smaller, but they seem fine (verified by a tire shop) so I've kept them on.   I have lived in this thing on and off for the past three years, it's been a great little home/truck.  I have moved on to bigger and better things and it's time to sell.    The interior was completely gutted and redone by a handyman and myself.  I rust treated everything on the truck bed when we did this.  It's not really air tight, but the Wallas XC duo puts out a ton of heat for hardly any energy (electricity/diesel).

It has very light usage with a total of 127,500 current miles = roughly 9,100/year over the 14-year lifespan. It has only been in 4wd a handful of times and was used 99.9% of the time to shuttle our kids around town and for Costco trips. It has never towed a trailer, the hitch was only used for a bike rack. We have always serviced it locally and on time. We installed slightly oversized BF Goodrich (BFG) LT275/60/R20 All-Terrain K02's about 15k miles ago, so those still have a ton of life still in them. This thing purrs and has many many years of great service ahead of it. We are only selling because one son drives himself to HS now, and we have downsized our vehicles. Turn it into a Luxurious Overlander!  Light Grey / Creme leather interior with Walnut trim. 2nd row Captain's chairs, and the usual 3rd-row bench (sits 7). WeatherTech mats in all locations (front wells, 2nd row, middle alley, 3rd row, rear cargo area). All 4 TPMS sensors (tire pressure monitoring system) valve stems were replaced in June. Passed SMOG on 6/30 and is ready to sell. A brand new CARFAX dated 5/20 can be emailed to you upon request. Registration is paid through October and ready for your Overlanding adventures this summer. We are located in Danville. Please email us with any questions. Thanks, Eric",

I\u2019ve applied tints to the car as well as installed halo LED projector headlights with new bulbs as well as adding a straight pipe to the car for a more aggressive sound.

The truck is in great shape all around, clean interior, paint is in good condition, starts right up. 4WD transmission shows no problems, AC works great, tires are almost new. Problem is, timing chain. Or at least that's what our mechanic tells us. If you've got the skills, you can fix that, or replace the engine. The good news? If you don't have the skills to rebuild it yourself, an engine for an F-150 can be readily acquired on eBay or elsewhere, and not too expensive either. This is a good truck for someone who can do some work, put in some elbow grease and wants to have something fantastic. For more info, please text or give us a call.",

It's proven to be incredibly reliable and has never even had a single recall. This car drives and looks like a dream. OBDII scan shows ZERO codes. The 4.7L 433HP V8 engine and 6-speed automatic paddle shift transmission are built by Ferrari and it shows when you drive it.   The body is a Pininfarina masterpiece. All four new tires.   On the car are OEM satin black Trident wheels which have BRAND NEW TIRES AND SENSORS.  One wheel has chipped paint and will need to be repainted ($125). None of the wheels have any curb rash. Also included free are the OEM silver wheels that were originally on the car. Three have three good tires.  The fourth tire is blown. I also have a brand new top of the line CoverKing indoor/outdoor weatherproof car cover.  It was over $700 and will be included with the car. The car does have some minor paint chips which is to be expected. Clean California title, current smog and registration in hand. If you're serious about the car, email me with your CELL PHONE NUMBER and I'll get in touch with you directly. Scammers, don't bother. I've seen them all. keywords: gran turismo sport mc stradale F430 alfa romeo porsche bently aston martin",

We are the original owners. We purchased it at our local Acura Bay Are dealership back in late 05 when me and my wife bought retired. It was our 1st brand new car. It is and has always been an amazing car. It is super reliable and has never let us down through out the years. It has always been maintained and serviced on time every time. According to the Acura manufacturer maintenance log book. And all of the services and maintenance are all up-to-date. Here is just a quick summary of the most recent maintenance and services that have been done- New belts/hoses, oils/fluids, flush\u2019s, tuneup, sensors, lubricants Awd, brakes, tires, cvc, battery and all that good stuff that the dealership recommended to have done or that was due at the 140K/150K maintenance and service. In order to keep maintaining its clean bill of health. According to Acura\u2019s standards \u2705.. The interior is In really good condition. Power everything, fully loaded with all the premium upgrades that the MDX touring series has to offer. Also everything is in working condition and all original. The exterior is also in pretty good shape. It does have a scratch/scrape on the left side bumper. That still is a mystery that of course happened at the Costco parking \ud83e\udd14. That happened a few years ago back. That place is crazy I hate that my wife goes there. But she insists that we go every week even though I park in the handicap, it feels like I\u2019m squeezing in to a stall. And it\u2019s like everybody forgets how to drive once you enter the parking lot it\u2019s like every man for their self no rules !!! But other than that it\u2019s has some really really minor nixs and stuff just thing that happens over the years. From being our daily driver through all of these years. My grandson took the photos just for this Craigslist Ad. For you can see the car as it is and for there is no surprise\u2019s. The Acura has a Clean Bill of Health, Clean Carfax, New Smog Certificate, New registration and it has never been smoked in nor never had any pets inside. We are selling the Acura for $ 6,450 ..FIRM\u2026 If you have any further questions or to schedule a appointment. Feel free to call my grandson at  show contact info . .\u260e\ufe0f\u260e\ufe0f\u260e\ufe0f.. PLEASE SERIOUS CALLERS AND BUYERS ONLY- NO EMAILS THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST\u2026",

        "seller_notes": "QR Code Link to This Post Hi Craigslist, We are seeking a New responsible Owner/Owners. That is going to appreciate and take care of The Acura. The way that we have over the years. The Acura is a 1996 Acura RL 4 door sedan, Premium Model, Automatic Transmission V6 3.5 liter engine with 147,000 original miles. We are the original owners. We purchased it at our local Bay Area Acura dealership. Has a retirement gift for me and my wife. It was our 1st brand new car ever. It was our dream car to own and we just loved all the luxury upgrades and the dependability along with having an affordable maintenance car. With out paying the premium prices for maintenance like those high end brands. It was one of the best decisions we have ever made. It is and truly has always been a super super reliable car. That has never let me down through out the years. It runs and drives amazing. It has always been religiously maintained and serviced on time every time. According to age not just the mileage. Since we was both retired we did drive much. Most of the mileage is from going to visit or grandchildren and children in Arizona and Southern California during those days. But know it just been our daily driver. To run errands, doctor appointments, and grocery shopping. It has always been maintenance and serviced by the Acura\u2019s manufacturer maintenance log book and all of the services and maintenance\u2019s are all Up-to-date along with all the maintenance records available. Here is just a brief summary of the most recent maintenance and service reports- New belts/hoses, oils/fluids, pumps, flush\u2019s, sensors, brakes, tuneup, tires, cvc, battery, Ac, and all that good stuff. That the dealership recommended to have done \u2705 or that was due \u2705 at the 140K /145K maintenance. That equivalent like if it was having the 200K maintenance. In order to keep it continuing, keeping its clean bill of health, and staying up to par. According to Acura\u2019s standards and good stamp of approval !!! The interior is In really good condition. It is fully loaded and has power everything. Lots of premium upgrades and has real leather seats and all the high quality components and upgrades. That Acura had to offer back then. In the premium model. Also everything is good originally working condition. The exterior is in pretty good shape also. Except for the paint fade spots . And The clear coat has been peeling here and there. On the hood, Roof and trunk. But other than that it\u2019s never been in any accident, it\u2019s a non smoking vehicle and no pets. But you can see what I am trying to explain in the pictures my daughter has taken for me . Just for this Ad/posting. So please zoom in the photos. Just for there is no surprise\u2019s. Because the rest of the car paint and body is in good shape for it age. I guess it just has happened over the years from being parked outside in the City in the Sunset district. A lot of our neighbors had the same problem with their vehicles. But that when we lived in the city. We moved out of the city about 10 years ago. Thank goodness \ud83d\ude05. Now that was a other good decision that we have ever made also moving away from all the hustle and bustle, traffic, parking and noise. We just couldn\u2019t keep up or tolerate it anymore. We needed to stretch our legs and have some breathing room. Since we were both in our mid/late 70\u2019s at the time. \ud83c\udd7f\ufe0f And we just wanted to slow down in our retirement years and obviously just sitting is not showing any signs of slowing down. It\u2019s just keeps growing growing and growing and getting faster, faster and faster. Going back to the Acura. This car has took us to all the places we always wanted to go /do and see.And we truly did everything we always wanted and talked about doing when we retired. And for the we are truly blessed. Because a lot of people can\u2019t say that. And I am truly thankful to the Acura for that because it had a big impact and role on doing those things. But most of all all the memories that helped us make specially enjoying it with my best friend and all my family for that I am grateful and those are the memories that I hold closest to my heart. It just feels like yesterday, and still puts a smile on my face. Those are the things that are most important things in life I tell you. But now it is time for it to go see a lot more new places and see new things for someone one else. But most of all to make some new memories for its new owner/owners. And I know it will do just that. It still has plenty of life left. It out ran us. It just like the energizer Bunny. It just keeps going going going and going.\ud83d\udc30\ud83d\udc30\ud83d\udc30 Just be good to it and I promise it will be good to you. So please respect our wishes for seeking a new owner/owners that plan on keeping it for has long has you can. And appreciate and take care of it and keep it has original has possible. Just the way have been all of these years. Who knows maybe one day you to can pass it on one day to your next generation to come. Just the way I am doing today. Heck ain\u2019t that what it is all about ??? Passing on good things to the next generation/ generation\u2019s \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb. I didn\u2019t plan on writing all of these things but I guess the new owner/owners need to know the history of the Acura and how special it has been for us . And played a big part/role in our retirement years in our lives. Well if you have future questions or to schedule an appointment you can call my daughter on her cell phone at  show contact info . \u260e\ufe0f\u260e\ufe0f\u260e\ufe0f. Please, she had requested that you call her no texting or no emails she will only respond to phone calls. The Acura has a Clean Bill of health, Clean Title, Clean Carfax, New Smog Certificate and Current Registration. We are selling the Acura for $4,950 FIRM\u2026 PLEASE SERIOUS CALLERS AND BUYERS ONLY-NO EMAILS NO TEXTING\u2026. THANK YOU FOR INTREST In THE ACURA",
