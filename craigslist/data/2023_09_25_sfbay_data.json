The seats are comfortable and supportive, and the ride smooth enough on the standard height-adjustable air suspension, making the Model S great over long distances. Two different settings allow you to choose heavy or light steering effort, the handling is crisp, and it's confident and almost tranquil on the highway. The steering is accurate and quick enough to make the S feel very agile, especially given it's size.  Technophiles will be in heaven and fans of modern minimalism adore the Model S's cabin, which comes standard with a giant infotainment screen that controls almost all of the vehicle's functions.",

Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?Many customers actually take delivery\u00a0without a checkbook or credit card.\u00a0While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.Do you take trade-ins?Yes.\u00a0We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.This is another very common situation that usually\u00a0won't\u00a0prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them \"don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me\". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask \"Where might I see this vehicle?\". Someone will respond promptly.I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.As America's Largest Automotive Retailer we have thousands of other vehicles,\u00a0including many others that may be identical to this one.Use the link below to view inventory from this and other nearby dealerships.\u00a0 \u00a0 http://atmxi.com/inventory/5140Description:* Engine: Primary Electric Motor (Rear) (997)  * Panoramic Roof  * Navigation System  * Rapid Red Metallic Tinted Clearcoat  * Interior Protection Package (Pre-Installed)  * Lane Keeping Assist  * Keyless Start  * Rear Spoiler  * Front License Plate Bracket  * Light Space Gray; Heated Perforated Activex Bucket Seats  * Transmission: Single SpeedThis vehicle includes a Money-Back Guarantee* and passed our precise inspection process.

Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?Many customers actually take delivery\u00a0without a checkbook or credit card.\u00a0While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.Do you take trade-ins?Yes.\u00a0We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.This is another very common situation that usually\u00a0won't\u00a0prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them \"don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me\". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask \"Where might I see this vehicle?\". Someone will respond promptly.I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.As America's Largest Automotive Retailer we have thousands of other vehicles,\u00a0including many others that may be identical to this one.Use the link below to view inventory from this and other nearby dealerships.\u00a0 \u00a0 http://atmxi.com/inventory/5143Description:* [F01] Charge Package  * [B10] Splash Guards  * [L92] Floor Mats & Cargo Area Mat  * [N10] Hologram Kick Plates  * Keyless Start  * Rear Spoiler  * [C03] 50 State Emissions  * Black; Cloth Seat Trim  * Brilliant SilverThis vehicle includes a Money-Back Guarantee* and passed our precise inspection process.

Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?Many customers actually take delivery\u00a0without a checkbook or credit card.\u00a0While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.Do you take trade-ins?Yes.\u00a0We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.This is another very common situation that usually\u00a0won't\u00a0prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them \"don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me\". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask \"Where might I see this vehicle?\". Someone will respond promptly.I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.As America's Largest Automotive Retailer we have thousands of other vehicles,\u00a0including many others that may be identical to this one.Use the link below to view inventory from this and other nearby dealerships.\u00a0 \u00a0 http://atmxi.com/inventory/5143Description:* Dc Fast Charging  * Keyless Start  * Audio System; Chevrolet Infotainment System  * Dark Galvanized/Sky Cool Gray; Deluxe Cloth Seat Trim  * Electric Drive Unit; (200 Hp [150 Kw] 266 Lb-Ft Of Torque [360 N-M])  * Emissions; California State Requirements  * Emissions; California Zev  * Engine; None  * License Plate Bracket; Front Mounting  * Lt Preferred Equipment Group  * Mosaic Black Metallic  * Seats; Front Bucket  * Tires; P215/50R17 All-Season Blackwall; Michelin Selfseal Puncture-Sealing  * Wheels; 17\" (43.2 Cm) Painted AluminumThis vehicle includes a Money-Back Guarantee* and passed our precise inspection process.

Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?Many customers actually take delivery\u00a0without a checkbook or credit card.\u00a0While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.Do you take trade-ins?Yes.\u00a0We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.This is another very common situation that usually\u00a0won't\u00a0prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them \"don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me\". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask \"Where might I see this vehicle?\". Someone will respond promptly.I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.As America's Largest Automotive Retailer we have thousands of other vehicles,\u00a0including many others that may be identical to this one.Use the link below to view inventory from this and other nearby dealerships.\u00a0 \u00a0 http://atmxi.com/inventory/5148Description:The following items have been reconditioned on this vehicle: new pair of tires!  * Panoramic Roof  * Navigation System  * Keyless Start  * Rear SpoilerThis vehicle includes a Money-Back Guarantee* and passed our precise inspection process.

You deserve a vehicle designed for higher expectations. This Tesla Model S delivers a luxurious, well-appointed interior and world-class engineering. This Tesla Model S has a flawless finish that complements its wonderful interior. Never visit the gas station again! The problem with electric vehicles has always been range. Tesla has dealt with this by employing bigger and better batteries in the Model S than have previously been seen in electric vehicles. Tesla still claims a 200+ mile range for the Model S, easily besting the range of its potential competitors. Beyond the drivetrain though, the Model S is a competent luxury car. There is lots of room both inside the passenger cabin and in the trunk, making the Model S both spacious and practical. The Model S matches most of the competitive European sedans in terms of luxury and performance; it offers other benefits they can't hope to match. Strengths of this model include an electric drivetrain, a luxurious interior with plenty of space, great performance, and good looks.   ============================================== ============================================== \ud83d\ude98 North State Auto      \ud83d\udcab FINANCE REQUIREMENTS: 1\ufe0f\u20e3 DRIVER LICENSE ~ (Must be Valid and Current) 2\ufe0f\u20e3 INSURANCE CARD ~ (Must be Valid and Current) 3\ufe0f\u20e3 PROOF OF INCOME ~ (Most Recent Pay Stub OR Bank Statement) 4\ufe0f\u20e3 PROOF OF RESIDENCE ~ (Most Recent Bank Statement OR Utility Bill) WE HAVE THE LOAN YOU NEED \u2b50\ufe0f EXTENDED WARRANTY AVAILABLE \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f ALL CREDIT SCORES CONSIDERED \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f WE ACCEPT MOST MAJOR CREDIT/DEBIT CARDS \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f GOOD CREDIT?(YES) DOWN PAYMENT AS LOW AS $0 DOWN \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f GOOD CREDIT ~ BAD CREDIT ~ NO CREDIT ~ FIRST TIME BUYER \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f WE WORK WITH CREDIT UNION MEMBERS \u2b50\ufe0f    \ud83d\ude98  North State Auto\ud83d\ude98   \ud83d\ude98  We are a locally-owned and operated premium used automotive dealer located in beautiful Walnut Creek, CA.

This Tesla Model S delivers a luxurious, well-appointed interior and world-class engineering. This Tesla Model S has a flawless finish that complements its wonderful interior. Never visit the gas station again! The problem with electric vehicles has always been range. Tesla has dealt with this by employing bigger and better batteries in the Model S than have previously been seen in electric vehicles. Tesla still claims a 230+ mile range for the Model S, easily besting the range of any of its potential competitors. Beyond the drivetrain, the Model S is a competent luxury car. There is lots of room both inside the passenger cabin and in the trunk, making the Model S both spacious and practical. The Model S matches most of the competitive European sedans in terms of luxury and performance, it offers other benefits they can't hope to match. Strengths of this model include an electric drivetrain, a luxurious interior with plenty of space, great performance, and good looks.  ============================================== ============================================== \ud83d\ude98 North State Auto      \ud83d\udcab FINANCE REQUIREMENTS: 1\ufe0f\u20e3 DRIVER LICENSE ~ (Must be Valid and Current) 2\ufe0f\u20e3 INSURANCE CARD ~ (Must be Valid and Current) 3\ufe0f\u20e3 PROOF OF INCOME ~ (Most Recent Pay Stub OR Bank Statement) 4\ufe0f\u20e3 PROOF OF RESIDENCE ~ (Most Recent Bank Statement OR Utility Bill) WE HAVE THE LOAN YOU NEED \u2b50\ufe0f EXTENDED WARRANTY AVAILABLE \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f ALL CREDIT SCORES CONSIDERED \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f WE ACCEPT MOST MAJOR CREDIT/DEBIT CARDS \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f GOOD CREDIT?(YES) DOWN PAYMENT AS LOW AS $0 DOWN \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f GOOD CREDIT ~ BAD CREDIT ~ NO CREDIT ~ FIRST TIME BUYER \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f WE WORK WITH CREDIT UNION MEMBERS \u2b50\ufe0f    \ud83d\ude98  North State Auto\ud83d\ude98   \ud83d\ude98  We are a locally-owned and operated premium used automotive dealer located in beautiful Walnut Creek, CA.

Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?Many customers actually take delivery\u00a0without a checkbook or credit card.\u00a0While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.Do you take trade-ins?Yes.\u00a0We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.This is another very common situation that usually\u00a0won't\u00a0prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them \"don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me\". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask \"Where might I see this vehicle?\". Someone will respond promptly.I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.As America's Largest Automotive Retailer we have thousands of other vehicles,\u00a0including many others that may be identical to this one.Use the link below to view inventory from this and other nearby dealerships.\u00a0 \u00a0 http://atmxi.com/inventory/5146Description:* Navigation System  * Lane Keeping Assist  * Keyless StartThis vehicle includes a Money-Back Guarantee* and passed our precise inspection process.

The battery still is in great shape with a full mile range at 100%. Full Air suspension with adjust ride height, premium sound system and an All Glass Roof/ sunroof. The rear facing jump seats completely fold down into a storage in the floor and can be flipped up if you need extra seats. These cars received extra reinforcement in the rear for safety and has been great for extra room for \"smaller riders\" like the back seat in the current \"Y\" model. Excellent car when Tesla was assembled with quality builds. I reluntantly am selling it since my family is growing and I did replace it with another Tesla but the SUV. No accidents with a clean title. Tesla's have the BEST of every car in it. Best ride comfort, sound system, seats, controls, electric car technology, and speed.

Including On Board Scale, heated steering wheel, modem, and truck bed camera I have tinted all the windows with Xpel ceramic tint.  Block 99% of UV and heat from the sun.  Extra comfortable during hot summer days when you only need to turn the AC on at low fan speed.  $1200 Has all the 2022 Ford Lightning Lariat extended range goodies and more: 511A package Ford C0-Pilot360 Active 2.0 Partitioned lockable storage in the back seat Tow Technology package On-board Scale w/ Smart hitch  \u2014 Estimate the weight of the load in your truck bed Twin Panel moonroof 20 inch alloy dark gray wheels All Terrain tires Liner floor mat Max Trailer tow package Bedliner If you are looking at this truck you probably know that it has bi-directional charging capabilities.  Meaning you can charge the truck and also use the truck to supply power for your home or anything that has an electric plug.   It comes with a mobile charger as well as a Ford Pro charger which I did not install.  This Pro charger, once installed, can charge the truck at 80 amps and supply power to your home in case of a power outage. We were lucky to have this truck during the storms this past winter season which knocked out power to our house for 2 days.  The truck was able to power 2 full size fridges, Starlink internet, and charging multiple electronics equipments (phones, iPads, laptops, batteries, etc) throughout the day.  The truck battery exceeded expectation and was extremely efficient as it used only 10% from supplying power to those things for 2 full days.  I could have gone on another 10+ days if needed.    It\u2019s like having a big generator for your home, and you can also drive it.   The battery size on this truck is 131kwh.  If you were to secure a Tesla battery wall system with 131 kWh battery capacity, the cost would be in the upwards of $100k. Please serious buyers only please.  Clean title in hand for an easy transaction.  Please send me your name and number and I will call you to schedule a time to look at the truck.  Prove of funds or loans prior to meet up if you are serious about buying the truck. Thanks.",

Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?Many customers actually take delivery\u00a0without a checkbook or credit card.\u00a0While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.Do you take trade-ins?Yes.\u00a0We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.This is another very common situation that usually\u00a0won't\u00a0prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them \"don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me\". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask \"Where might I see this vehicle?\". Someone will respond promptly.I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?Yes.

Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?Many customers actually take delivery\u00a0without a checkbook or credit card.\u00a0While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.Do you take trade-ins?Yes.\u00a0We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.This is another very common situation that usually\u00a0won't\u00a0prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them \"don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me\". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask \"Where might I see this vehicle?\". Someone will respond promptly.I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.As America's Largest Automotive Retailer we have thousands of other vehicles,\u00a0including many others that may be identical to this one.Use the link below to view inventory from this and other nearby dealerships.\u00a0 \u00a0 http://atmxi.com/inventory/5148Description:The following items have been reconditioned on this vehicle: new pair of tires!  * Panoramic Roof  * Navigation System  * Keyless Start  * Rear SpoilerThis vehicle includes a Money-Back Guarantee* and passed our precise inspection process.

Low mileage (39,998 miles!) and garaged in the Bay Area, it's very tough to find a 914 in this condition with little to no rust, very decent original interior and what looks like shiny original black paint.  Bolted to the nicely functioning transaxle and clutch is a massive General Electric DC motor from a 1970s Bradley GTE, known as the \"rolls royce\" of DC electric motors. This motor has a steel commutator and can take more rpm and abuse than others like it. There are two lithium A123 battery modules up front from Thunderstruck motors in Santa Rosa. Two new Thunderstruck battery chargers mounted above the motor can fill the battery from empty in two hours. A battery management system from Thunderstruck has also been installed. This drive system has been trouble free and enjoyable to drive. Think \"set it and forget it\" and not endless tinkering and trouble.  The previous owner converted the car in the 1990s, so the motor and curtis controller are from that era, and are of relatively low voltage. The 10kwh battery has much larger capacity than the original lead acid pack and much smaller (weighs about 200 pounds). It's currently running at 90 volts, so top speed is about 75 mph, but still plenty of fun low speed torque. I have another motor and controller I can include that would significantly increase top speed and more than double the power with some simple changes to the battery arrangement to double the voltage. It's current range is about 30 miles, depending on how you drive it.  I've enjoyed working on this car and it's been lovely to drive it around. The suspension and steering feel quite nice, thanks to the bilstein shocks, relatively low miles and all new vredestein tires. The gauge cluster was recently restored and brake master cylinder replaced.  It doesn't need a whole lot to be a solid driver. The front struts appear to rattle while driving, there's a small leak from the brake reservoir hose and most of the weatherstripping needs to be replaced to keep rain out of the car. Around $300 worth of rubber seals are included.  So fix a few things and drive it as is, or upgrade for relatively cheap. Replacing the battery in the frunk with four tesla modules or three VW id4 modules would double the range at the same battery weight and be relatively easy to do.  It's far simpler to work on than a modern ev and more fun to drive. If you are a serious buyer write me an email that indicates you read the whole ad and are serious about keeping it electric. Otherwise I may ignore it. Thank you for looking.",

(More pics coming soon) All the character for which Golfs are famous isn\u2019t lost in the EV option.  Such a blast to drive you\u2019ll make up errands just to take it out for an evening spin.  These cars are an excellent around-town vehicle for errands, short trips and would make a perfect beginner vehicle for a teen just learning to drive Max nominal range on a full charge is around 85 miles. No smog required. These cars are famously low-maintenance vehicles and don\u2019t come with all the bugs and build-quality issues common to Tesla, Nissan Leaf and other EVs.  Never charged to 100% in order to preserve the battery.  Options include: front seat heaters, nav and bluetooth connectivity w Apple CarPlay, auto dimming rear view mirror, HID auto headlights, auto climate control, Keyless entry, rain sensing wipers, and back up camera. I\u2019ve really enjoyed owning and driving this car but we just had a baby and I needed a bigger vehicle to haul around the stroller and all the other gear.  The cons of this car are as follows: Small battery means it doesn\u2019t go too far on a charge. Good for commuter but not suited to road trips.  Anyone familiar with modern Golfs knows that they don\u2019t have a ton of cargo space.  However - great car for those who just need a zippy ride for errands or keeping your teen from driving down to LA with their friends on a whim.   Vehicle will be delivered cleaned following VW dealer inspection.  Will only conduct sale at my credit union in San Francisco. Bank check, no cash.  Not interested in dealing with purveyors of spam or kickers of tires.  Available to show in Sausalito, Marin City, Mill Valley area.  Car will come with two portable chargers.",
