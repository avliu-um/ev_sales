Then, after only 6 or 7 weeks the bottom dropped out of rideshare, literally overnight in my area. I was only making 15 percent of what I was making before. In addition to the claim increasing my insurance premium to an unaffordable payment, I can no longer afford the car. I am not asking for charity, in addition to the car to make up for my mistake I am offering my current 2 bedroom home with appliances. Home is in pretty decent shape but could use some work. Home has more lot space than your typical city lot, as much as 5x more. can easily be turned into an offgrid homestead. comps are lower but they dont have a third of an acre. I will also be using the funds to travel to Central America for dental work because I did not qualify through the VA (pre-existing condition). They removed 9 teeth in bootcamp and I lost some later, very hard for me to enjoy meals and life overall. Or if by chance there is an angel investor that will give me 120k in return for a 15 year mortgage (hoping for 5 percent or lower) on the home, we would be eternally grateful. Please text or email only, Ill gladly call you back.",

The flood waters made it to the middle of the wheels while it was parked overnight. The trunk area had some dampness in it but no standing water was visible inside the rest of the interior. It is very clean inside and out and it powers up with the dash, big info screen, AC, heat and radio working normally.  I can't get shift it out of park which is most likely due to blown fuses that I can't find. The screen shows multiple BMS codes and the dashboard cluster says \"unable to start\". I do have both sets of keys and the battery health is normal with 50% charge left. If you know about EVs or kmow of an EV repair shop near you, this may be a great opportunity to get a deal on a 2020 Model X Long Range Plus with all of the bells and whistles.

(not done yet) Looking to sell at this price because I used it in ride share service because of the free supercharging. I was making 4-X the car note. Then, after only 6 or 7 weeks the bottom dropped out of rideshare, literally overnight in my area. I was only making 15 percent of what I was making before. In addition to the claim increasing my insurance premium to an unaffordable payment, I can no longer afford the car. I am not asking for charity, in addition to the car to make up for my mistake I am offering my current 2 bedroom home with appliances. Home is in pretty decent shape but could use some work. Home has more lot space than your typical city lot, as much as 5x more. can easily be turned into an offgrid homestead. comps are lower but they dont have a third of an acre. I will also be using the funds to travel to Central America for dental work because I did not qualify through the VA (pre-existing condition). They removed 9 teeth in bootcamp and I lost some later, very hard for me to enjoy meals and life overall. Or if by chance there is an angel investor that will give me 120k in return for a 15 year mortgage (hoping for 5 percent or lower) on the home, we would be eternally grateful. Please text or email only, Ill gladly call you back.",

The flood waters made it to the middle of the wheels while it was parked overnight. The trunk area had some dampness in it but no standing water was visible inside the rest of the interior. It is very clean inside and out and it powers up with the dash, big info screen, AC, heat and radio working normally.  I can't get shift it out of park which is most likely due to blown fuses that I can't find. The screen shows multiple BMS codes and the dashboard cluster says \"unable to start\". I do have both sets of keys and the battery health is normal with 50% charge left. If you know about EVs or kmow of an EV repair shop near you, this may be a great opportunity to get a deal on a 2020 Model X Long Range Plus with all of the bells and whistles.  It's black in color but wrapped in a tan satin wrap with door jams wrapped in white. Has a clear flood title with \"flood\" notated on the title and its registered and plated on my name. It comes with all of the owners manuals, 2 original keys and factory window sticker showing all of the included options. MSRP is 102,690.00 Some options it includes is the full self driving package (currently a 15k option) premium sound system, air ride auto adjusting suspension, premium white 6 passenger seat configuration. and a bunch of other options.  This Tesla is being sold As Is and I will not accept any refunds or exchanges.  It is registered and plated on my name and the title will be transferred directly to the new owner, upon completion of sale. No bank lean or loans on the title.  Title is branded with FLOOD notated on it. It's not a salvage or rebuilt title and can be transferred to the new owner without the need for a state inspection. For questions or to see additional photos,  three 1 three, triple 7, thirty 2 sixty 5 for questions. I'm open to reasonable offers.",

Then, after only 6 or 7 weeks the bottom dropped out of rideshare, literally overnight in my area. I was only making 15 percent of what I was making before. In addition to the claim increasing my insurance premium to an unaffordable payment, I can no longer afford the car. I am not asking for charity, in addition to the car to make up for my mistake I am offering my current 2 bedroom home with appliances. Home is in pretty decent shape but could use some work. Home has more lot space than your typical city lot, as much as 5x more. can easily be turned into an offgrid homestead. comps are lower but they dont have a third of an acre. I will also be using the funds to travel to Central America for dental work because I did not qualify through the VA (pre-existing condition). They removed 9 teeth in bootcamp and I lost some later, very hard for me to enjoy meals and life overall. Or if by chance there is an angel investor that will give me 120k in return for a 15 year mortgage (hoping for 5 percent or lower) on the home, we would be eternally grateful. Please text or email only, Ill gladly call you back.",

The flood waters made it to the middle of the wheels while it was parked overnight. The trunk area had some dampness in it but no standing water was visible inside the rest of the interior. It is very clean inside and out and it powers up with the dash, big info screen, AC, heat and radio working normally.  I can't get shift it out of park which is most likely due to blown fuses that I can't find. The screen shows multiple BMS codes and the dashboard cluster says \"unable to start\".

(not done yet) Looking to sell at this price because I used it in ride share service because of the free supercharging. I was making 4-X the car note. Then, after only 6 or 7 weeks the bottom dropped out of rideshare, literally overnight in my area. I was only making 15 percent of what I was making before. In addition to the claim increasing my insurance premium to an unaffordable payment, I can no longer afford the car. I am not asking for charity, in addition to the car to make up for my mistake I am offering my current 2 bedroom home with appliances. Home is in pretty decent shape but could use some work. Home has more lot space than your typical city lot, as much as 5x more. can easily be turned into an offgrid homestead. comps are lower but they dont have a third of an acre. I will also be using the funds to travel to Central America for dental work because I did not qualify through the VA (pre-existing condition). They removed 9 teeth in bootcamp and I lost some later, very hard for me to enjoy meals and life overall. Or if by chance there is an angel investor that will give me 120k in return for a 15 year mortgage (hoping for 5 percent or lower) on the home, we would be eternally grateful. Please text or email only, Ill gladly call you back.",

The flood waters made it to the middle of the wheels while it was parked overnight. The trunk area had some dampness in it but no standing water was visible inside the rest of the interior. It is very clean inside and out and it powers up with the dash, big info screen, AC, heat and radio working normally.  I can't get shift it out of park which is most likely due to blown fuses that I can't find. The screen shows multiple BMS codes and the dashboard cluster says \"unable to start\". I do have both sets of keys and the battery health is normal with 50% charge left. If you know about EVs or kmow of an EV repair shop near you, this may be a great opportunity to get a deal on a 2020 Model X Long Range Plus with all of the bells and whistles.
