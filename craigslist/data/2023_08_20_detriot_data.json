Full factory warranty. This is not the little Bronco Sport model. This is the true full size Bronco 2 door model. Doors, roof panels, rear seat sky panel, and hard top are all removable just like that other brand. Been told this is one of first ones made and that you can't order any manual transmission units nor any Heritage units at this time. When and if you can in the future who knows how long it will take to get it and what model year it will be. 2023 is the first year offered and this was just built in July 2023. Great opportunity as either a collector item for personal collection or simply to be the first one around to actually have one let alone see one. As seen and shown at Woodward Dream Cruise, Saturday 8/19/2023. Serious certified funds/cash buyers only. No joy rides. I don't need help selling and I am not looking for trades since vehicle has note on it. Inquiries by reply email only please.",

When it was recovered the only thing wrong was that the wheels and tires were missing and yet the insurance company sent it to insurance auction which means the State Of Michigan classifies it as a \"rebuilt\" title. I believe this is not what should happen to a stolen and recovered vehicle with wheels and tires missing but when it comes to Michigan Secretary of State, \"you can't fight city hall\" (and win) as they say. The 2007 GT500 parts came from 1ZVHT88S175285929. I have documented proof for both vehicles. Purchaser of vehicle at insurance auction then stripped the body down to just the body and rotisserie painted it from V6 White to GT500 Red. It was re-assembled using 2007 GT500 Chassis, Powertrain, and Interior OEM factory pieces. It was subsequently upgraded to 2013/2014 GT500 Supercharger and tuned by Paul Svinicki at Paul's High Performance in Jackson, Michigan. The vehicle now makes 700+ hp at the engine and 600+ hp at the tires with dyno sheet proof. The vehicle is really good but is not perfect or a car show winner by aesthetics.  Asking $35,900.00 or best in person cash offer. FiveEight6 Eight2Three 35Hundred Unfortunately, I recently had a perspective buyer of a showroom new vintage moped crash it on a test ride and then said he didn't want to buy it because it was now crashed. Lesson learned: I will not let this happen again.  No test drives unless agreed upon selling price, proof of funds, and a deposit. Also, no test drives for those who are not manual transmission operation literate. Please learn on someone else's clutch.",

Small amount of damage to the rear bumper and muffler. Causes muffler to be a bit noisy but doesn\u2019t affect how it runs. Odometer has been stuck since I bought it 6 years ago. It sits at 132,000 miles. I rarely drove the car so I\u2019d guess it\u2019s around 150,000 miles at most. It was more of a backup/project car. Life hit and I unfortunately don\u2019t have the time needed to put into it.",

Title has no lien on it its ready to sign over.The only issue I noticed recently is when car is warming up it shutters somewhere in the driveline between 2nd and 3rd gear I believe, than it goes away when car is fully warmed up. This is why the vehicle is priced below market value. Car is being sold as. You can contact me if you would like to look at it or have any  questions. I will be happy to provide you with the information you request. No trades, Cash only.Thank you.",

It is in perfect condition. It has a 4cyl turbocharged engine and is very fun to drive! The AWD is very nice in the snow as well! It has Pirelli all season run flat tires meaning if a tire pops, you can drive it up to another 50-60 miles to a dealer or repair shop so no need to pull over and change a tire. No modifications have been done to it except for the window tints and the black kidney grille inserts. The tints are nice to help keep the interior cooler in the summer since it is black interior. I still have the original inserts with the chrome trim that I will add in for free. Please reach out to me, Brendan, at  show contact info .",

When temps get below 15oF, the engine kicks on no matter what to keep the batteries conditioned and that\u2019s where most of those \u2018miles\u2019 are from). 107 lifetime MPGe (mile per gallon equivalent), 250+ lifetime MPG. Both numbers are tops for this climate.  This car has been garage-kept (parking deck at work), VERY well taken care of, non-smoking family and driven 98+% in electric mode. The Chevy Volt is an extended-range EV where an engine kicks in to charge the battery if you run out of charge. Full-charge range is around 70 miles in the summer (see recent pic) and 50 in the winter on the coldest of days (around 0oF). A full tank of gas will take this car another 400 miles after the battery charge is used up (10 gallon tank and 40+ miles per gallon).  Thermal imaging pics prove heating/cooling and steering wheel heating all work just fine. Bluetooth Wireless connection for hands-free communication, AM/FM Radio w/MyLink, Backup Camera, F&R Side Air Bags, Dual Air Bags, Knee Air Bags, F&R Head Curtain Air Bags, Traction Control, StabiliTrak, ABS (4-Wheel), Tilt & Telescoping Wheel, Keyless Start (can also start the car through the OnStar app which is great for having a warm car to get into in the winter before leaving from work or home). Paid off, no accidents, no issues, no dash lights, clean title. Pulled CarFax report on 8/16/23. Both key fobs work. New front tires Nov 2022. Voltec warranty good to 8 years and 100,000 miles and 8 years is up NEXT September (2024). Great car, just don\u2019t need it any more (have 4 kids taking classes at the college that I teach at so won\u2019t need my own vehicle for years to come). Comparable: Carvana #1: https://www.carvana.com/vehicle/2799448 Carvana #2: https://www.carvana.com/vehicle/2768381 Carvana #3: https://www.carvana.com/vehicle/2799118 Some of these comps have slightly less total miles, but not less engine miles. Only 1,580 engine miles on my car and that engine is going to last a very long time.",

It could use a few finishing touches or drive it as is. I purchased the car about 5 years ago, but due to some oil pressure issues, the engine was replaced approximately 3 years ago (Approximately 1200 miles since installation). The engine was brand new from Germany still wrapped in plastic. It is a 1.8L (MK3 block) with upgraded JH hydraulic head originally intended for the VW factory in Mexico. The person I bought the engine from purchased a large batch of engines from VW as the factory had shut down before the engines were ever installed. During the installation, I replaced essentially everything along the way. The only \"performance\" upgrade I did was a lower from stress bar to tighten up the stock suspension setup. The Montego black Wolfsburg option included body-colored wheel arches, bumpers, and mirror caps from the factory. The wheel arches would use some rattle can work to make them perfect again.  New parts (within the last 3 years):  Engine (complete)  Clutch kit  Injectors and cups  Axles  Tie Rods  Front brakes  Rear shocks  Radiator  Waterpump  Thermostat  Radiator hoses  Engine Mounts  Euro Sport 4-point Lower Front Stress Bar  Many other bits including sensors, gaskets, relays, etc.  Known Problems:  Front windshield seal needs replacement (New parts included)  Slow battery drain from radio circuit (Can demonstrate by removing fuse or disconnecting radio)  HVAC fan doesn\u2019t work  Slight oil pan drip (2-3 drops) when parked if the car gets nice and hot after a drive  Speedo indicates exactly 10 mph over actual speed  I never fixed any of the problems because I used the car purely in the summer on nice days. It didn\u2019t seem necessary when I keep it on a 12v tender and don\u2019t drive in the rain.  I\u2019m happy top answer any questions.

Was owned first by a collector for 17 years and 5,733 miles. Then a little woman school teacher for 8 years, she drove it on weekends and vacations and to school once a year on the last day each summer. Then I purchased from her in 2019 with 19,xxx miles on it. Opti spark service, full service and tune up by the second owner 2,000 miles ago, runs and drives like new. The original air filter was recently replaced with a GM AC Delco but also kept original, it's a little dirty... Also includes rubber cup holder adapter and center cap tool very rare and normally missing and lost years ago.. Very nice low mileage car, driven almost monthly in season to various car activities and/or up Woodward as I live close by..  Listed in the Firehawk registry. T-Tops, auto, 5.7 300HP, special Firehawk wheels. I have another Firehawk (95) and several other cars and am wanting to reduce the number before fall. The price is firm and the car will not be sold for less, as I have no issue keeping it at all.   Shown by appointment only and Text is best especially during the working hours on week days. Calls ok after hours until 9-9.30 or weekends. I need no help selling and don't need scammers and spammers to waste my time..",

Runs, drives, shifts, stops as it should, no dash lights at all. In unusual and desirable Turquoise Metallic paint, just over 1,100 made in this color. Lots of recent work done, including tune up, oil change, new GM air filter, AC recharge, front lower spoiler replaced, outer door seals replaced by Master Works.( local Corvette restoration shop) This beautiful Corvette was ordered with optional 6 way power adjustable black leather sport seats, blue removable roof, 3.07 performance axle, oil cooler, select ride suspension and more. 5.7 L98 with 4 speed auto. Good tread but older tires with working TPS sensors,(another option.) as stated earlier drives fine. I have gone over 80 in it and taken several 20-30 mile trips in it chilling it the AC no issues at all. The paint isn't perfect but very presentable especially for the age of the vehicle. Perfect car for Sunday morning drives or taking to Cars & Coffee events or local car shows, always gets compliments and interaction due to color and condition. Only selling due to having too many cars and wanting to reduce my collection.(3 Corvettes plus others.)  I would gladly keeps and have no problem doing so and selling another car or two instead. $13,500 or best in person offer.  Shown by appointment only and Text is best especially during the working hours on week days. Calls ok after hours until 9-9.30 or weekends. Note, the black gills are the most recent pics and they are decals that can be easily removed.    I need no help selling and don't need scammers and spammers to waste my time..",

I want to save you thousands of dollars.  These are the secrets that dealerships, and private sellers do not want you to know.  1-This had No accidents.  You can easily check the car going under it.  All the metal is intact.  All the front bumper reinforcements(the metals that protect you when ur in a crash are in perfect, solid conditions).  Get under the bumper and you will see for yourself.   Remember, if you go out and get other cars, when winter comes and you slide to other cars, you will NOT be protected.  You family members might get seriously hurt.  Think about that.  This alone should be the reason why you SHOULD get this car.  It's safe.  The next time ur in an accident, you will be in trouble if you get other cars.  Winter is here in about 2-4 months.  We are in Michigan remember? 2-This is a mechanic with 40 years experience talking about this car: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pABe33AYpCE&t=267s Must be on desktop to view. Now, Why this GMC Envoy? 3-2 owner 4-Privately owned Took to mechanic and spent money to prep for next buyer. 5-Got rid of abs sensor wire speed sensor $200 6-New oil change full synthetic with new drain plug and new filter. $120 7-New wheel bearing.  $45 plus $300 labor.   8-New seat covers $100 9-New steering wheel cover $22  10-New high quality mats $45 autozone. 11-Brakes, shocks and the suspension are all good.    12-Tires with over 90% tread left. 13-New serpentine belt installed. All these things cost money and time.   14-I guarantee you that you will spend more on other lower quality vehicles.   Meeting in front of madison police department on 13 and john r. 15-The car looks great.  The color makes the car stand out as there are not many GMC with a gray color like this.   16-Its very comfortable all wheel drive system that will get you through every road in Michigan.  The next time you are in an accident, you will be safe and protected by this car.  Good for you and your family. 17-Engine: Runs smoothly.   I'll drive the car to the Madison Pd for the meetup.  I am not sure what more you would want! 18-Other cars got a lot of problems and they won't even tell you.   I am telling you all I know. 19-We know that other sellers do not care about you. 20-A lot of private sellers are just trading in their bad cars as well.  Some are selling them on craiglist.  These guys have a bad vehicle that need major fixes and they wanna get rid of it.  Why would they be selling their car and not using it themselves?  Think about it.    21-I already told you all I know about this car.  Its one of the best used SUVs on facebook. 22-I don't replace car parts, engine parts with junkyard parts.  Come on now.  I am not that kind of guy. This is a really nice SUV.  If you wanna learn more about gmc envoy, look up the specs on google. 23-Price is going up soon to $6999.  I am also actively taking this car for display publicly and it will be sold in the streets.    24-REMEMBER, other sellers are selling you JUNK.  Their left-overs because they don't want their car because it is very bad.  Even if you spend money on this car in the future, it will be LESS than what other people are giving out.  It is that good.",

My objective, to help get it back on the road as we worked in the same industry.  This amazing Camaro was garage kept its whole life looks to not have been driven in the winter months.  I can imagine how happy the original owner was when he bought this Z28 new, only 2 years after he joined the US Army, sole owner from July 1984 - Jan2023 (At that time I took possession).   The vehicle includes all records; original Ziebart receipt when purchasing the car, all Registration and Insurance slips indicating single ownership, dealership mile certification, and manuals. About the car.  This good condition 1984 Chevrolet Camaro Z28 with the optional High Output Package 5-liter V8 blue on blue is a beautiful time capsule of a single owner Metro Detroit Retired US Army service member who was part of a Camaro club that met at events around Detroit over the years.  One could imagine him driving this Z28 5spd to the Detroit Tank Arsenal in the summer months as happy as anyone could be. I respectfully restored this car to \u201croad worthy status\u201d keeping the car as original as I possibly could upon receipt.  To include the original self-made tape/stereo he had in the car at the time it was parked in 1997.  Here is a list of what I mean by road worthy status\u2026Pictures are available of each step if interested.   My definition of Road Worthy Status::: With a car, this age, there are a few rubber parts that will become brittle and original leaded fuel that gums up over time as it evaporates when a vehicle sits.  Those items are what I focused on.  Please see the list below.  Note: all receipts available upon request. New; rear shocks, front struts, front/rear torsion bar bushings, front rotors/rear drum/brakes/calipers/cylinder, master brake cylinder/brake booster, front inner/outer wheel bearings and seals, front/rear brake lines, dual rear emergency brake cables, front/rear BF Goodrich P245/60R15 100S M+S Radial T/A tires, fluids [rear dif/axle, oil/filter, power steering, gear box, radiator], rear fuel tank/straps/fuel pump kit, flushed fuel lines, OEM carburetor seals/throttle body sensor/clean jets/secondaries, upper/lower radiator hoses, electric cooling fan, all belts, windshield wipers, thermostat, radiator cap, air filter, spark plugs/cap/rotor, professional 2 stage paint buff/wax/interior/engine detailed, front/rear hood/trunk gas struts, interior exterior light bulbs where needed, battery, and Cherry Bomb exhaust. The car is 40 years old next year so the paint does have a few surface things that are expected in a Midwest vehicle. But nothing that a professional could not touch up if someone wanted to make it perfect, I purposely left alone as it is how I received it. There were some small paint repairs done many years ago and a few surface rust spots that were a result from the OEM hood protector that collected water.  But the original Ziebart did a wonderful job of preserving the Z28 for its 39 years of service.   The Z28, I believe, with the low mileage and few paint areas is priced well, all work done to the car is priced fair. With that said, I am willing to negotiate. For those that want a solid base vehicle with a plan to drop in a loping crate engine making it a sexy sleeper, well this is a perfect car to have fun with\u2026..  Or if you simply want to start driving today, do a few burn outs at a light in a no check engine light ready to drive 1984 Z28 5 speed that gets thumbs up wherever you go then leave it as is\u2026\u2026.a time capsule with all its records intact!\u2028\u2028 The Camaro Z28 is a special performance automobile in its day.  This particular year Z28 won motor trends car of the year awards for handling/performance. If preserved in this good condition, it's a truly rare and noteworthy all records daily driver find. I am Wishing the next owner will be the steward of the original owner\u2019s story, his service to our country, and overall proud to drive a true piece of automotive history. Please call/text with name and number to arrange an appointment, feel free to get in touch anytime call/text if you have questions.",

We completed all recalls, and the big one: replaced the engine head gaskets in 2021. We kept the receipts.  This is a Saab by its badges but beneath the hood it's a Subaru Impreza. If you know you know -- it's a fun little car. We're moving away from the area & will no longer need a second car. Clean green title, currently registered & in use, etc.",

The vehicle was sold and driven in Texas for 12 years before coming to Michigan. The previous owner had it for 9 years. Before being driven to Michigan, it went a comprehensive mechanical rejuvenation, including an engine rebuild, full transmission service with new filter and gasket, new rotors and brake pads, new serpentine belt, water pump, new air and cabin filters, new battery, wiper blades front and rear, and 4 new high-performance tires. Everything on this vehicle works perfectly, especially the AC. The vehicle has a sunroof, cruise control, auto headlights, driving lights below the front bumper, power windows and mirrors. Light-duty hitch  is great for a bike rack.The spare tire has never been used. No accidents, no rust anywhere. A very sporty and versatile Toyota that will easily go another 100k+ miles with zero additional expenses. Great back-to-school vehicle, well worth the $5300 asking price.",
